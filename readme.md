# One

This is work in progress, not fit for use (yet)

### Summary

One is a small (one template) library for expressing and enforcing
the distinction between quantities (amounts) of different things.
Quantities of the same thing can be added and subtracted, 
and multiplied and divided by plain values.
Quantities of different things can't be added or subtracted.
Quantities can be multiplied, but this sort-of multiplies what
they are quantities of, just like physical units.
